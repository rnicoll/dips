==Abstract==

This DIP describes changes to BIP0070 to adapt it to be suitable for use with Dogecoin Core.
Decisions made in BIP0070 are Bitcoin-specific, and minor changes are required to ensure no
accidental cross-over between the two specifications. This specification should be read
in combination with DIP0071.

===PaymentDetails/PaymentRequest===

Where network names in BIP0070 are "main" and "test", for Dogecoin the networks are
referred to via genesis block hash. The field for this is "genesis". This ensures
forward-compatibility with other coins and networks, without requiring network
names to be detailed in a central directory.
