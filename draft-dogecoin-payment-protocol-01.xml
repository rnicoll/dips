    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines a protocol and file formats for payments using Bitcoin-derived
      cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin. This protocol is intended to simplify the payment processing
      from the perspective of the customer, as well as reducing scope for user error.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Currently cryptocurrency payment solutions suffer from a number of issues:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>They often require the user to manually cut &amp; paste the payment address and amount.</t>
          <t>There is no verification of the origin of a payment request</t>
          <t>There is no integrity check on a payment request to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks</t>
          <t>There is no automated solution for providing refund addresses as part of a payment</t>
          <t>The receiving user or system may have to poll to check for payments,
            instead of receiving notification when payment is sent</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The Dogecoin payment protocol addresses these issues by automating much
        of the payment negotiation process. The protocol defines a sequence of
        messages to be exchanged between the merchant server and user's client
        software.
      </t>
      
      <t>
        The Dogecoin payment protocol is intended for use with the Dogecoin cryptocurrency,
        however should be usable with most Bitcoin-derived cryptocurrencies with no
        modification.

        <t>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to elements of cryptocurrency

            <t hangText="address">A hashed public key, which can be used as an endpoint to

    <section title="Outline">
      <t>The payment protocol exchanges three messages between the merchant
      server and the wallet software:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
          <t hangText="PaymentRequest:">Retrieved by the wallet client. Defines the

          <t hangText="Payment:">Sent by the wallet client to the merchant server once
          payment has been sent. Specifies the transaction(s) which
          form the payment, as well as details of where to refund payment
          to if necessary.</t>
          <t hangText="PaymentACK:">Returned to the wallet client from the merchant
          server in response to the Payment message. Acknowledges receipt of

        This document describes payment over HTTP as a transport layer.
        Other transport layers (such as NFC) are left for future work.

      <t>The default payment protocol steps are as follows:</t>
      
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Merchant server prompts user for payment</t>
          <t>User initiates payment (for example opens a URL link)</t>
          <t>Wallet client downloads the PaymentRequest message from
          the merchant server</t>
          <t>Wallet client prompts user to confirm the payment</t>
          <t>User confirms payment</t>
          <t>Wallet client sends payment in accordance to instructions in PaymentRequest</t>
          <t>Wallet client sends Payment message to merchant server, describing how payment was sent</t>
